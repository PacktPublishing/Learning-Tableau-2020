# Errata and improvements
This file contains corrections to the errata or mistakes in the book.

## Page 34 - The dashboard interface

*Figure 1.26* was not updated to account for a user interface change. However, the options available in this pane in Tableau 2020 are detailed in the text on page 35.

## Page 57 - Connecting to Google Sheets

The URL link in the book as well as in the Tableau workbook does not exist anymore. As follows is a new link to connect to the Google sheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YUZ1UnryuCX7cwbfNptGuzx0G4yth7i-m9Jrkce9_PE/edit#gid=793425053](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YUZ1UnryuCX7cwbfNptGuzx0G4yth7i-m9Jrkce9_PE/edit#gid=793425053).
To follow the steps as given in the exercise *Connecting to data in the cloud*, follow the preceding URL link instead of the one given on page 57. 

## Page 73 - Read about Dimension and Measure Filters

'*you should always think about whether you are using the field as a 
**Dimension Filter** or a **Measure Filter** to understand what kind of 
results you will get based on the order of operations, which is 
discussed in the Appendix.*'

There is no *Appendix* in this book, however you can read about Tableau's **Order of Operations** in detail in the Tableau help pages: [https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/order_of_operations.htm](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/order_of_operations.htm)


## Page 75 - Other filtering options

'_**Filters** may be added to the **context**. Context is described in detail in the
Appendix and we'll see why it's important in various examples throughout
the book._'

There is no *Appendix* in this book, but you can read more about **context** as the book proceeds further, as it is referenced in various examples.

## Page 83 - Building a Bullet Chart

The name of the worksheet **Average Minutes to Service (Bullet Chart)** in point 1 doesn't match with the worksheet explained in the figure below it in the book. 

Point 1 should be: 'Navigate to the **Revenue Per Department (Bullet Chart)** sheet.'

## Page 149 - Parameters
Point number 5 in the bullet list, '*Change the size of bins*' is duplicated by mistake, and should be ignored.
